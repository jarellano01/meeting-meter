# Meeting Meter
Meeting Meter is a simple front end JavaScript Web App that was inspired from constant pointless meetings that often seem pointless to go to. 
One day, I decided to create Meeting Meter just to test out my new JavaScript skills that I gain from the UCLA Bootcamp (early in the course), and this what came out of it.

Remember this is all front end JS only so neither the counter nor the table will not persist if the page is refreshed. The counter will also pause if you switch tabs or hide your browser on a phone. 

None the less, I think my point was made when I first presented this app at my next meeting.

## Live Website
The live website can be found in the link below:

## How to Use
The point of this app is not to go out and find out everyone's exact salary. For the most part I think we can all guess our co-workers salary. 
With that said, use guestimates in the following steps.

1. Go to the Live Website above
2. Click on "Add Attendee" and a modal will appear
3. Enter the Employee Job Title (ex. Project Manager)
4. Enter the guestimated hourly rate
   - Once again this is a an average so it's always better to guess lower
   - Example: I would guess that a Project Manager makes around $90,000 a year + 30% burden (probably more in reality) / 2080 (number of work hours in a year. I would hope you work no more than that)
   - Ultimately this would give you an hourly salary of about $56 / hour
5. Enter how many of those employees you have (ex. 3 Project Managers attending the Meeting)
6. Repeat these steps for each type of employee

This will give cost per minute, per hour, and per day just to give people a good shock.
Once the meeting begins put this screen in the meeting for everyone to see and press start. 

##My Experience
Well I ultimately created this app for the purpose of testing my JS skills but I figured I'd test it out in a meeting. I don't think the person holding the meeting was to exited to see the true cost of holding a pointless meeting but everyone else seemed to enjoy it. 

Ultimately we had less pointless meetings (or I was just not invited) so it this simple app made it's point.

##Contribute
